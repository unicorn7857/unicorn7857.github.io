        <h6></h6>
        
        <p>To start off, I always thought coding was <em>so</em> cool but I didn't think <br>I could <em>ever</em> learn how to code. One day, my teacher showed us<br> how to code but it wasn't computer coding, it was just telling a little<br> robot to move forward and backwards, which was <strong>sooooo</strong> boring.<br>Then after school, I came home and went straight to Khan Academy <br>to see if they had any coding courses and to my surprise they had <br>soo many! I immediately started the JS (JavaScript) program and I enjoyed it so much that I finished the whole course in a week and a <br>half! I know it sounds crazy but it's true! I created a few really cool programs and I was <em> really</em> eager to learn more so I started learning<br> HTML and CSS.
And now I'm here! I hope you enjoyed learning how I started coding and be sure to check out some of my other blog entries!

            My favourite parts about coding
        </h2>
       
        <p>
        First, I'll list a few things I love about coding then I'll explain why I<br>love it !
        <ol id="ol">
         
            <li>Experimenting!
            <li>Creative Freedom!
            <li>Personalization!
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        1. I loveeee experimenting because it's a great way to  understand what<br> you're doing right or wrong <br>
        2. When you are coding you have <em>soooo</em> much creative freedom and when <br>you can be as creative as you want you can create the best projects<br>
        3. Sometimes other peoples' projects aren't the way you like your <br>projects to be and one way to fix that problem is to spin-off their project and personalize it the way you like it !
